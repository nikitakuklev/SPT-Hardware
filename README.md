# SPT-Hardware
### CAD (Autodesk Inventor) file repository for various SPT parts - most are intended for 3D extrusion printing

**Motor adapter** - a plate to couple (but insulate electrically) PT410 pulse tube motor to the bulk of the BlackCat cryostat. Printed as a solid for rigidity.

**KF50 Tubes** - a set of experimental 3D vacuum fittings...they almost worked too! (held ~E-3 Torr vacuum after careful mating surface polishing)

**Heater controller box** - a box for arduino-based blackbody heater controller, with carefully (aka painfully) calibrated holes for BNC connectors
